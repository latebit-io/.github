## Why do we use and value the description craftmanship? 

We really value a high level quality of code, architecture, and thought into every project. We love technology and want it to be the best it can be, no marketing gimmicks, we simply we want the best developed technologies. So many platforms and applications simply fall apart or are hard to work with due to code rot and debt reaching critical mass.
