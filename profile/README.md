## Why do we use and value the description craftmanship? 

We really value a high level quality of code, architecture, and thought into every project. We love technology and want it to be the best it can be, no marketing gimmicks, we simply need the best developed technologies. So many platforms and applications fall apart or are obtuese and slow to work with due to code rot/debt reaching critical mass.

We want to help you adopt a craftmanship mentality and reap the benefits of cleanly built projects. We need and strive for in our own software and solutions.
