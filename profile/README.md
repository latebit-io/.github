## ü™ö Why do we use and value the description craftmanship? 

We really value high quality code, well designed architecture, and we put a lot of thought into every project. We love technology and from our many years of experience there is nothing better than woking with a well crafted project. Unfortunately many platforms and applications fall apart or are obtuse and slow to work with due to code rot/debt reaching critical mass. Some projects simply collapse due to poor planning and not factoring in enough time making deadlines unreasonably tight.   

We want to help you adopt a craftmanship mentality and reap the benefits of cleanly built projects.

## üõπ Why the name lateflip.io? 

Late flip is a trick in skateboarding that takes experience to achieve and looks very impressive. We want companies to be impressed by our work and see the fruition of our experience. But really it is just a name of a impressive skateboarding trick. In the spirit of that trick is what we want to accomplish with our consulting and development.
