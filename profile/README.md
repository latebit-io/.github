## Why do we use and value the description craftmanship? 

We really value a high level quality of code, architecture and thought into every project, we want it to be the best it can be. So many platforms and applications simply fall apart and the time to production for new features or even a revisions start to degrade and overall hinders companies delivery, or worst case simply fail.

We want to help you adopt a craftmanship mentality and reap the benfits of cleanly built project, as we want and strive for in our own software and solutions. 

## Why the name lateflip.io? 

Lateflip is a trick in skateboarding that takes experience to achieve and looks very impressive. We want companies to be impressed by our work and see the the fruition of our experience; so your company has the means to "late flip". But really it is just a name of a cool looking skateboarding trick, in the mentality of that trick is what we want to accomplish with our consulting and development.
